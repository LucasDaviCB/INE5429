# INE5429

How to run the algorithms:

1 - Open the folder of the desired primality algorithm (the one you want to check)

2 - Inside this folder, type: python3 filename.py > outputname.txt

- Where filename.py is the name of the algorithm code (like fermat_linear.py) and outputname.txt is whatever name you want the output file to have + .txt on the end

3 - It should create an output file in the same folder that you had opened, with similar content to the output files that can be found at /INE5429/results folder

4 - Open the output file that you created to read the output of the code

MAYBE EXTRA STEP 5 - if the output is null, without anything, the source code probably have the print's at the end all commented, so please, uncomment this if you need to see that output

The only files that will probably have this problem are the pseudo-random number generators, because their output always polluted the output from the primality files, so for the primality outputs sake, I commented it
